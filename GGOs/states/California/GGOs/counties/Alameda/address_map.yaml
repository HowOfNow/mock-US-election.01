# Implementation notes:  there are no address-map-redirect or blank-ballots
# keys here because there are none.  When there are none, one must walk back
# up the tree until the first address-map-redirect is found.  And then walk
# down the tree to find blank-ballots.  That happens to be where that data is
# if it is needed to from this spot.  But the ElectionConfig should explicitly
# have it regardless.
